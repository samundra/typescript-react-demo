## Demo React app with Typescript setup

This is the sample react app with typescript demo setup taken from
[LogRocket Tutorial Link](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-why-a-guide-to-using-typescript-with-react-fffb76c61614)

I had to make some adjustments to make this work as tutorial is from
2017.

Following changes were required to make it work.

- Webpack now uses "rules" instead of "loaders"
- Added "typescript" as dependency
